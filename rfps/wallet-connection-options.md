# Mobile Wallet Options for Polymesh 

* **Proposer:** [Polymesh Association](https://polymesh.network)
* **Status:** Open

## Project Description :page_facing_up: 

Approaches like WalletConnect allow a dApp to delegate transaction signing to any arbitrary wallet, including mobile wallets, via QR codes and direct communication with the wallet.

This broadens the range of wallets that could be used with Polymesh dApps giving users more choices for how to secure their private keys.

**Business Rationale:** Allows a broader range of wallet solutions, including both custodial, MPC-based and self-custodial.

**Approximate time (person week):** 12 weeks.

**Impacted Components:** Tooling.
